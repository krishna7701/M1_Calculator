# Calculator  

## Introduction:-   
Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic operations in mathematics , they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this project which I Implemented operations with complex and fractions numbers. 

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction, in another word it is implemented with the
order of precedence logic.    


The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator % is normally used with data values. To print the remainder
operator %% is used in the first printf() function. The variable ch store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two
numbers. The switch has condition “ch” so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and display result to the screen. If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error! Invalid Operator.” to the screen.

What?

 A calculator is a small hand-held computer that performs mathematical calculations. Some calculators even permit simple text editing and programming.
 
When?

 People do calculations usually use calculators in everyday life to save their time and for accurate answers.
 
Where?

Many times, in scientific and mathematical calculations involving complex operations with complicated numbers the calculation is not feasible because it will take a lot of time and there are many chances of errors when done manually.

Why?

To make calculations easier.

How?

The memory chips inside the calculator thousands or millions by bytesprogram code that allows the calculator to do work.



## Swot Analysis
| STRENGTHS | WEAKNESS | OPPORTUNITIES | THREATS |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| can solve complicated problem easily | People will become lazy | The future value calculator can be used to determine future value, or financing. | Cheating. The availability of graphic calculators has made it easier for students to cheat during their tests. |
| The ultimate strength calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long lasting etc.. | do not include all the operations rather have only addition,subtraction, multiplication, division, power , factorial,volume and length | The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other | The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world. |


## High Level requirements:-
| ID | Description | Category |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | 
| HLR01 | User should able to view operation list | technical |
| HLR02 | User should able to select the operation | technical |
| HLR03 | The system should be able perform the given operation | technical |
| HLR04 | The system should provide correct result | technical |

## Low Level Requirements:-
| L1:Basic Operation | L2:Differentconversion | L3:Basic math function |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Basic operations like additon, substraction, multiplication and division takes place. | All the conversions of Length, speed and volume. | In this basic math functions like square root, power, exponentials takes place |
