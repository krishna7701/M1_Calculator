# Calculator  

## Introduction:-   
Simple calculator is a project to allow users to calculate basic operations in mathematics , they are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division but in this project which I Implemented additonal operations such as Factorial,power, Length converter,Volume converter and speed converter. 

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/Length/volume/speed, in another word it is implemented with the
order of precedence logic.

The switch-case statement is used to write a simple calculator program in C language. The remainder operator % is normally used with data values. To print the remainder
operator %% is used in the first printf() function. The variable ch store the operator, similarly the variables num1, and num2 stores the two
numbers. The switch has condition “ch” so the entered operator is matched with which case label those case label statements are executed, and display result to the screen. If the entered operator is not matched with the case labels then the default statement will be executed and it will display the message “Error! Invalid Operator.” to the screen.
